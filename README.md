# Research on Decentralized Media Platforms: cases from Hong Kong



## Current Work


### Abstract

Technology has stimulated, altered and configured the media world. To embrace the prevailing blockchain technology as a great patron of many existing applications, media platforms have also implemented other decentralized technologies to generate some secure and sustained features including the peer-to-peer networks and the distributed-storage system. Using the cases of decentralized technology-based media platforms taking place in Hong Kong, this article seeks to examine the platformsâ€™ contribution to two aspects of their social impact: (1) the expansion of audience reach on social movements and (2) the empowerment of personal expression on critical issues. Drawing upon the scraped time series viewing data and Google searching data of Telegram, an instant messaging phone app, together with the open textual data from Matters Lab, an online blogging community, this article investigates the substantial attention drawn from subscribers of protest-info channels on Telegram and the salient topics being discussed on Matters Lab. Hence, this article argues, these decentralization-based platforms have served as a contributor to the engagement, mobilization, agenda highlighting, and circulation of social issues, as they provided a certain degree of security, sustainability and freedom of speech.
