Research on decentralized media platforms: cases from HK

Technology has stimulated, altered and configured the media world. To embrace the prevailing blockchain technology as a great patron of many existing applications ranging from finance to property rights, media platforms have also implemented decentralized technology and the concepts behind to generate some peer-to-peer and permanently-stored features. Using the cases of decentralized technology based media platforms taken place in Hong Kong, this article seeks to examine their contribution to two aspects of the social impact: (1) the allowance of personal expression on critical issues and (2) the audience reach of mobilization on social movement. Drawing upon the scraped time series viewing data and Google searching data of Telegram, which is an instant messaging phone app, together with the open textual data from Matters Lab, which is an online blogging community, this article investigated the salient topics being discussed on Matters Lab and the substantial attention drawn from subscribers of protest information channels on Telegram. Hence, this article argues that these platforms have served as a contributor to the discussion, circulation, and off-line actionsâ€™ organization of social issues, as they provided a certain degree of security, sustainability and freedom of speech.
