## Data Ethics

Although the scrapd real-time and view counts data from Telegram Channel do not contain any texs about protest information, I have taken them down from this public repository given the privacy protection concerns. It would be going through IRB if this article would be published in the future. The Google searching trendiness data is publicly available at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com). On the other hand, regarding the Matters Lab data, it credits to [their public repository](https://github.com/Terminus2049/matters-metadata).
