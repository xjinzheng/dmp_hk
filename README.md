# Decentralized Media Platforms: Cases from Hong Kong



## Current Work

### Keywords
Decentralized Technology, Media, Social Engagement, Security, Hong Kong

### Instant Messaging

_Telegram_ had a surge of user downloads in Hong Kong as the extradition bill evoked societal conflicts and turbulence. The “Channels” on Telegram were usurped as information sources for people to spread, exchange and even vote about details of “when and where to do what”, as well as to request for emergency assistance and supplies.

### Content Sharing

Start-up _Matters Lab_ has created an free and sustainable online blogging community to promote personal expression and content sharing. Finding a balance between quality and quantity, it highlights the social agenda.


## Data Ethics

Although the scrapd real-time and view counts data from Telegram Channel do not contain any of protestors information, I have taken them down from this public repository given the privacy protection concerns. It would be going through IRB if this article would be published in the future. The Google searching trendiness data is publicly available at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com). On the other hand, regarding the Matters Lab data, it credits to [their public repository](https://github.com/Terminus2049/matters-metadata).

## Envision

Future work would encompass the online experiments in comparison with other media platforms.
